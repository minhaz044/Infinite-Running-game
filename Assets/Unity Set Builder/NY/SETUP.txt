1)    Modular Construction / Vertex Snapping 
 
 
You can assemble your worlds more easily with a feature called Vertex Snapping. This feature is a really simple but powerful tool in Unity. It lets you take any vertex from a given mesh and with your mouse place that vertex in the same position as any vertex from any other mesh you choose. 
 
With this you can assemble your worlds really fast. For example, you can place roads in a racing game with high precision and add power up items on the vertices of a mesh. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Using vertex snapping in Unity is simple. Just follow these steps: 
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
 
1.1)  Select the mesh you want to manipulate and make sure the Transform Tool is active. 
1.2)  Press and hold the V key to activate the vertex snapping mode. 
1.3)  Move your cursor over the vertex on your mesh that you want to use as the pivot point. 
1.4)  Hold down the left button once your cursor is over the desired vertex and drag your mesh next to any other vertex on another mesh. 
1.5)  Release your mouse button and the V key when you are happy with the results. 
1.6)  Shift-V acts as a toggle of this functionality. 
1.7)  You can snap vertex to vertex, vertex to surface and pivot to vertex.
